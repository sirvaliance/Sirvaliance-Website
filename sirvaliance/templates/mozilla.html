                <h2>Why Mozilla?</h2>
                <p>Simply because Mozilla is a great organization that works on and advances the open source movement. I would love the opportunity to work with intelligent people in a fast paced work environment.  I have appreciated the work of past Mozilla tools like Firefox and Thunderbird and can see the great potential for things to come, particularly when I run the beta build Aurora.</p>

As part of The Crypto Project, I maintain the website and services as well as act as an administrator to the network.  My freelance work is primarily focused on Web Developement, Design, and Server Administration.</p>

                <h2>Why This Position?</h2>
                <p>I am currently applying for the position of <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Careers.aspx?c=qpX9Vfwa&cs=9Kt9Vfw1&page=Job%20Description&j=o75XVfwO">Web Developer</a> because it is the position at Mozilla that most suits my current skillset. I have also applied to and would like to be considered for <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Careers.aspx?c=qpX9Vfwa&cs=9Kt9Vfw1&page=Job%20Description&j=o52SVfwE">Web Application Security Engineer</a>, <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Careers.aspx?c=qpX9Vfwa&cs=9Kt9Vfw1&page=Job%20Description&j=oIkXVfwE">Web Developer</a> and <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Careers.aspx?c=qpX9Vfwa&cs=9Kt9Vfw1&page=Job%20Description&j=opcXVfwd">Support Community Manager</a>.

                <p>I know that might seem like a lot, but seriously, if Mozilla needed a full-time dog walker, I would apply for that as well.  If there is a position you have in mind that might suit my skillset better, please make me aware of or consider me for that position as well.  I would love to be a part of Mozilla!</p>
                <p>It would be a dream of mine to be able to say I work for Mozilla and hold a salaried position and still have the freedom of a telecommuter.  I would also love to have the opportunity to move out to Mountain View.</p>

                <p>I founded <a href="https://crypto.is">The Crypto Project</a> and it officially <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/cryptodotis/status/91771687233785856">launched on July 15</a>.  From the website, &#8220;The Crypto Project is an organization designed to assist and encourage anonymity and encryption research, development, and use&#8221;.  The project has 4 goals:
                <ul>
                    <li>Building a website that becomes an authoritative, reliable, and current resource for those learning how to achieve privacy, security, and anonymity.</li>
                    <li>Bringing the security, cryptography, and development communities together to work on projects, discuss ideas, and unite to create progress.</li>
                    <li>Build a large network of anonymity, privacy, and censorship circumvention services.</li>
                    <li>Create, assist in creating, promote, and help others use software to achieve privacy, security, and anonymity.</li>

                <p>We have been lucky enough to have a two part <a href="https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/behind-scenes-crypto-project-083011">Interview with Threatpost</a> as well as being covered in <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/08/31/0424251/The-Crypto-Project-Revives-Cypherpunk-Ethic?utm_source=slashdot&utm_medium=twitter">Slashdot</a>. <a href="https://blog.crypto.is/TCP-Newsletter-One/">In our first month</a>, we saw plenty of progress being made which I am especially proud of.  We consistently have 60-80 members in the IRC chatroom discussing, collaborating, and working on various projects.  We have so many intelligent and friendly contributors and it makes me so proud to say I was a catalyst to make it happen.</p>

                <h2>Collaboration and Remote Team Work Experience</h2>
                <p>Considering that a few of the positions (specifically the <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Careers.aspx?c=qpX9Vfwa&cs=9Kt9Vfw1&page=Job%20Description&j=o75XVfwO">Web Developer</a> postion) allow for remote and/or telecommute work, I feel as though my past work and skillset is extremely fitting.  At The Crypto Project, all work is done remotely and our project is managed through our <a href="https://github.com/cryptodotis">Github Organization</a>.  My freelance work is primarily done remotely as well.  I would love to transition my way to moving out to San Francisico and becoming part of the Mountain View team.  It has been a dream of mine to move out west (these Midwestern winters take their toll).</p>

                <h2>Why I Am Capable To Work This Position</h2>
                <p>All of the Job Skill Requirements and Preferred Skills found in the <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Careers.aspx?c=qpX9Vfwa&cs=9Kt9Vfw1&page=Job%20Description&j=o75XVfwO">Web Developer</a> position read as a description of my day-to-day work.  My primary language for web projects is Python (for approximately 5 years now) and have experience building on most of the major frameworks.  Answering the job posting, I have hands on experience with Django (this application is actually built using Django on <a href="http://gondor.io">Gondor.io</a>) and have worked on jobs where CodeIgniter was the primary framework.  I like to think of my web work as language agnostic, having worked projects using PHP, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, and even one where we used LISP on top of Hunchentoot.  </p>

            <p class="headline_text">My Work on The Crypto Project</p>
            <div class="grid_5 prefix_1 alpha">
                <p>As the founder, I orginally conceived the idea and designed and built out the website within the span of a day (when I work, I work fast).  I originally built the site using <a href="http://tornadoweb.org">Tornado</a>, but once it became clear we needed a wiki for user contributed content I devised a different architecture.  For visual design and security reasons, I was hesitant to use any of the wiki software out there and decided our best option was to create a repository of Markdown templates.  I forked and modified <a href="https://github.com/sirvaliance/gollum">Gollum</a> for our <a href="https://wiki.crypto.is">Wiki</a>, and subsequently built (hacked together is a better term) a static site generator called <a href="https://github.com/sirvaliance/hoggle">Hoggle</a> to build both our site and <a href="https://blog.crypto.is">blog</a>.  All of our server builds and updates are automated and managed through <a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.2.2/index.html">Fabric Scripts</a>.  I am passionate and a strong believer in automating anything that can be automated.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid_5 omega">
                <p>As well as writing and setting up our website, I have set up and work as an administrator to our <a href="https://crypto.is/projects/network/">Network</a>.  In our network, I have setup and operate a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Relay</a>, a <a href="http://mixminion.net/">Mixminion Relay</a>, a <a href="http://convergence.io/">Convergence Notary</a>, a <a href="https://torproject.crypto.is/">TorProject.org Mirror</a>, and have begun work on a <a href="http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs">Tahoe-LAFS</a> grid behind Tor hidden services.  All of our services run behind an Nginx reverse SSL proxy and we like to implement secure features like <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HSTS</a>.</p>
                <p>I am a passionate developer who spends my day's working on open-source code, talking to hacker friends on IRC, and working as an activist for open source software and knowledge, particularly related to privacy, anonymity, and security.  I would love to bring the passion and talent exemplified in current work to Mozilla!

                <h2>My Research and Bookshelf</h2>
                <p>My current interests are reading and researching security, anonymity, and privacy texts and constantly expanding my knowledge as a developer and creator.  I continually push myself to become better, more efficient, and always search to discover new tools, methodologies, and approaches to the act of creation.</p>
                <p>I have a mini library of authoritative texts on various topics that I am pushing my way through, from SICP to the Dragon book, I hope to get through them all.  I have an interest in remailers and mixnets, and love reading white papers from <a href="http://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/">AnonBib</a>.</p>

My latest work can be found at my <a href="http://sirvaliance.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp page</a>.
